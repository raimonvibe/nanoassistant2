# *NanoAssistant2: Your Funny AI Buddy*

**Tired of always getting the "right" answers?** Want to have a chat with an AI thatâ€™s just as quirky as your best friend? Then NanoAssistant2 is the perfect project for you! ðŸ¤–âœ¨

Inspired by: [NanoAssistant by reese3222](https://github.com/reese3222/nanoassistant)

## ***What's NanoAssistant2?***
NanoAssistant2 is a voice assistant project that uses **GPT-2** for its brains, meaning youâ€™ll get some hilariously offbeat responses that are guaranteed to make you smile. Weâ€™ve also thrown in **Whisper** for voice input/output, making it feel like youâ€™re talking to your AI buddy IRL.

## **How to Get Started**
1. **Clone the repo:** `git clone [https://github.com/reese3222/nanoassistant.git](https://github.com/raimonvibe/nanoassistant2.git)`
2. **Install all the good stuff:** `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. **Run the magic:** `python nanoassistant2.py`

## ***Why It's Fun to Use***
- ðŸ˜† **Funny conversations**: GPT-2 can sometimes be a bit wild, so be ready for unexpected, entertaining answers.
- ðŸŽ¤ **Voice input/output**: Itâ€™s not just text â€“ youâ€™ll be chatting with this AI like you would with a friend!
- âœ¨ **Super customizable**: Tweak the code to make it more or less weird â€“ your choice!

## **Tips for Best Experience**
- **Use clear and simple prompts** to get the funniest responses. The more straightforward your question, the more creative GPT-2 gets!
- Want more randomness? **Increase the "temperature" parameter** in the code. This will make the responses even more unpredictable! ðŸ”¥
- If itâ€™s too slow, consider **downscaling the model** or running it on a faster machine â€“ GPT-2 can be a bit demanding.

## ***Troubleshooting***
- **Audio Issues?** Make sure your microphone is properly configured and working.
- **Slow responses?** Try running on a machine with more RAM, or reduce the model size.

## **Have Fun!** ðŸŽ‰
This project is all about having a good time. Donâ€™t take it too seriously â€“ thatâ€™s what makes NanoAssistant2 so unique!
