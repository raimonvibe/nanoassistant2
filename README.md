# *NanoAssistant2: Your Funny AI Buddy*

**Tired of always getting the "right" answers?** Want to have a chat with an AI thatâ€™s just as quirky as your best friend? Then NanoAssistant2 is the perfect project for you! ðŸ¤–âœ¨

Inspired by: [NanoAssistant by reese3222](https://github.com/reese3222/nanoassistant)

## ***What's NanoAssistant2?***
NanoAssistant2 is a voice assistant project that uses **GPT-2** for generating responses, meaning youâ€™ll get some hilariously offbeat answers that are guaranteed to make you smile. We use the **Hugging Face pipeline** to power GPT-2, and the project supports **voice input/output** using `speech_recognition` and `pyttsx3`, making it feel like youâ€™re chatting with a real AI buddy!

## **How to Get Started**
1. **Clone the repo:** `git clone https://github.com/raimonvibe/nanoassistant2.git`
2. **Install all the dependencies:** `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. **Run the script:** `python nanoassistant2.py`

## ***Why It's Fun to Use***
- ðŸ˜† **Funny conversations**: GPT-2 can sometimes give unexpected and hilarious responses, making each interaction unique.
- ðŸŽ¤ **Voice input/output**: Speak to NanoAssistant2 and have it speak back â€“ no need for boring text chats!
- âœ¨ **Super customizable**: You can tweak the code to adjust the responses, speed, and style to fit your preferences.

## **Tips for Best Experience**
- **Use clear and simple prompts** to get the funniest responses. The more straightforward your question, the more creative GPT-2 gets!
- Want more randomness? **Adjust the "temperature" parameter** in the `generate_response` function. Increasing this value will make responses more unpredictable! ðŸ”¥
- If the responses are slow, consider **running the project on a machine with more processing power** or using a smaller model.

## ***Troubleshooting***
- **Audio Issues?** Ensure your microphone is connected and recognized by your system. You may need to check your systemâ€™s audio settings or permissions.
- **Slow responses?** Try reducing the `max_length` parameter in the `generate_response` function or running it on a more capable machine.

## **Have Fun!** ðŸŽ‰
This project is all about having a good time and enjoying the quirky interactions with your AI buddy. Donâ€™t take it too seriously â€“ thatâ€™s what makes NanoAssistant2 so special!
